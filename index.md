## About Me

I am Huiqi Zou. 
<!-- an incoming PhD student working under the guidance of <a href="https://wyshi.github.io">Prof. Weiyan Shi</a> at Northeastern University. -->
I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University</a>, where I completed a thesis under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ziangxiao.com/">Prof. Ziang Xiao</a>.<br>
Previously, I earned a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Stream) from <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk">City University of Hong Kong</a>, where I completed my final year project under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/aisquaredlab/'>Prof. Linqi Song</a>. 

## Research Interests
My research interest lies in human-computer interaction (HCI) and natural language processing (NLP), especially in the field of interactive evaluation. I am currently fascinated by the following <b>research questions</b>:
- What is the role of interaction in system building and evaluation?
- How to conduct evaluation in a task-driven scenarios? 

My ultimate goal is to build interactive systems for more engaging human-computer communication and transition from static evaluation methods to more flexible, task-driven assessments that capture the diverse scenarios in which models are deployed.
